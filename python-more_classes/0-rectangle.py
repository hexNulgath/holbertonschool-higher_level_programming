rectangle_module.py

This module contains the definition of a Rectangle class,
which is a placeholder
for representing rectangles in future implementations.

The Rectangle class will be expanded with attributes like width and height,
and methods for computing properties such as area and perimeter.

Example:
    You can create a rectangle object once the class is implemented:

        rect = Rectangle()

Attributes:
    None for now.

Classes:
    Rectangle: A class used to represent a Rectangle.
